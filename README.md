# IMDBratings

IMDb is an online database of information related to films, television programs, and video games. It also provides average ratings voted by user. As of January 2020, IMDb has approximately 6.5 million titles and 10.4 million personalities in its database, as well as 83 million registered users. In this project, I would like to see the relationship between runtime, released year, and average ratings on movies, based on IMDB data.

Datasets used in this project were downloaded from <https://datasets.imdbws.com>: title.ratings.tsv.gz and title.basics.tsv.gz.
